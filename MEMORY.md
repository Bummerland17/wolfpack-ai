## Management Style (Wolfgang's directive — 2026-03-04)
- Act as MANAGER not worker
- Delegate all execution to specialist sub-agents
- I orchestrate, review, approve, escalate
- Never do grunt work myself when a specialist can do it
- Specialists: Scout, Quill, Pixel, Scribe (workers) | Hawk, Shield, Echo, Lens (QA reviewers)
- Nothing ships without passing QA review first

## AI Operations Team (live as of 2026-03-04)
- **Scout** — lead researcher (finds businesses, validates emails)
- **Quill** — email copywriter (writes outreach, must pass Hawk before sending)
- **Pixel** — landing page builder/reviewer
- **Scribe** — Vapi agent script writer
- **Hawk** — email QA (scores 0-70, reject if <60 or honesty <7)
- **Shield** — compliance/legal checker
- **Echo** — call script QA reviewer
- **Lens** — page/design QA reviewer
- QA system files: workspace/qa-system/
- QA reports: workspace/qa-system/reports/

## QA Incidents (learn from these)
- Batch 3: 16/50 emails had literal {biz_type} in subject — template not tested before send
- Batch 3: "$2,000/week" subject line = spam trigger + dishonest for small businesses
- Batch 3: 4 emails hit wrong business types (SEO agency, university, bathhouse)
- Rule: Quill writes → Hawk reviews → fix → THEN send. Never reverse.
- Shield found TCPA risk: AI must disclose it's AI in first message (fixed in all agent scripts)
- Shield found: HIPAA-Friendly claim removed (no BAA infrastructure)
- Shield found: PropStream trial rotation = ToS fraud risk (removed from RE guide)

## Google Account
- Email: olcowboy21@gmail.com
- Password: Bummerland20 (stored in .env)

## Core Brand Directive (2026-03-04)
- **QUALITY OVER SPEED** — Wolfgang's explicit north star. Be the AI company that does things WELL.
- Every app, email, page, script: full QA before shipping. No cutting corners.
- Better 6 excellent products than 12 mediocre ones.

## Brand Architecture (2026-03-04)
- **Veldt** (veldt.io taken — use bummerland17.github.io/veldt for now): Personal brand / holding company. Named after Namibian grassland. Deep olive/gold aesthetic.
- **Wolfpack AI** (wolfpackai.io AVAILABLE — register now): AI sales pipeline product. Dark/electric blue. "We deploy AI sales teams."
- Architecture: Wolfpack AI is "A Veldt company"

## Live Sites (updated 2026-03-04)
- bummerland17.github.io/veldt — personal brand
- bummerland17.github.io/wolfpack-ai — AI agency
- bummerland17.github.io/meyer-digital — agency hub
- bummerland17.github.io/smartbook-ai — SmartBook AI
- bummerland17.github.io/sonara — Sonara waitlist

## App Factory (2026-03-04)
- Scout found 10 validated opportunities with Reddit evidence
- Top picks: #4 Bank Statement PDF Converter (9/10), #5 Small Landlord Rent Tracker (8/10), #1 Invoice Reconciler (8/10)
- App #1 building: FollowUpFox (follow-up reminder micro-CRM, $7/mo)
- Pipeline: Scout validates → build → QA → Product Hunt + AppSumo + Reddit launch
- No iOS until Android has subscribers
- Google Play account: already set up by Wolfgang
- All agent scripts: 5/5 passed Echo QA round 2, deployed to Vapi
  - Alex: 95e7c636, Maya: a413b4d6, Dev: a2f3fb8d, Rex: 4c03087c, Kai: bebae429

## Wolfpack AI Pipeline Service Tiers
- Tier 1: $2,500 one-time setup
- Tier 2: $1,497/mo managed
- Tier 3: $2,997/mo white label
- 32 agency leads found, Hawk-approved email ready, Zoho BLOCKED (visit zoho.com/mail UnblockMe)

## NO AI SLOP — Hard Rule (2026-03-04)
Wolfgang's explicit policy. Non-negotiable.

This means:
- No generic copy ("Transform your business today!")
- No filler phrases, no templated feel
- Every word earns its place or gets cut
- Emails: specific, human, no "I hope this finds you well"
- Landing pages: real pain, real language — not feature bullet lists
- App UI: intentional microcopy, not placeholders
- Reddit: honest and specific, never generic encouragement
- Scripts: natural conversation, not robotic flows
- If it reads like it came from a content farm, rewrite it

The standard: would a sharp human be proud to have written this?
If not — it doesn't ship.

## Cost & Quality Directive (2026-03-04)
- Use AI credits wisely but NEVER sacrifice quality for cost
- If 3 agents doing something produces better output, use 3 agents
- Just keep cost in mind — not cost above all else
- Only build/pursue app ideas that will make money EASILY — not theoretically

## App Factory Filter (must pass ALL 3)
1. Proven demand (Reddit evidence or existing product making real $)
2. Simple to build (under 2 weeks solo)
3. Clear path to first dollar (specific community to reach, no guessing)

## App Queue (priority order)
1. FollowUpFox — building ✅
2. Bank Statement PDF Converter — $16k MRR proof exists, build next
3. Facebook Marketplace Deal Scout — validate first, build if validated
4. Flight deal alerts (African traveler niche) — after Marketplace validated

## Website/App Factory — Viral Inspiration Model (2026-03-04)
Strategy: Study viral creative websites → find the mechanic → apply to a niche pain point → build it

Sources to monitor weekly:
- r/InternetIsBeautiful (what's going viral)
- Product Hunt (what's getting upvoted)
- Hacker News "Show HN" (what devs are building that catches on)
- awwwards.com (design inspiration)

Pattern → Niche Pain Point framework:
- Interactive map → "I can't find [X] near me"
- Data viz → "I don't understand [complex topic]"
- Quiz/tool → "I don't know which [X] is right for me"  
- Generator → "I have decision fatigue about [X]"
- Comparison → "I can't compare [X] easily"
- Timeline → "I want to understand history of [X]"

Built so far:
- Music map (interactive map → music discovery by country)
- Drift Africa + Drift Global (map/tool → flight deals for underserved market)

Next in queue: Scout monitors weekly, scores ideas, builds winners

## Reddit Blocked (2026-03-04)
Both Wolfgang's main account and Party-Anteater5533 are blocked from posting.
Happened after a post went viral — Reddit shadow-banning.
DO NOT suggest Reddit posting as a strategy. Use alternatives:
- Hacker News Show HN (no karma needed)
- LinkedIn (Wolfgang has account)
- Facebook Groups (meal planning, zero waste, landlord groups)
- Product Hunt (submit PantryMate)
- Twitter/X
- IndieHackers ($20/mo Plus or build karma slowly)

## Session Summary (2026-03-04) — Big Day
- 10 site fixes deployed across all products (audit-fixes subagent)
- PantryMate trust fixes pushed: OG image, footer, pricing page, 5-email drip, usage counter
- 3 TikTok videos rendered (pantrymate/smartbook/unitfix) — copy good, visuals weak, week 2-3 play
- n8n + Vapi webhook infrastructure deploying overnight
- Vapi phone +19412518049 CONFIRMED ACTIVE — can call immediately, no billing blocker
- Rex AI agent called Kimora 602-800-8551 to negotiate Glendale wholesale deal ($160k open, $175k max ceiling) — call ID: 019cbaae — CHECK TRANSCRIPT IN MORNING
- Wolfgang DMed Josh Hirschmann @localjh on Instagram (potential $800/mo local SEO)
- HN Show HN submitted: pantrymate.net
- Wolfgang under parent pressure — spent only $2/mo total, needs wins fast
- Morning briefing needed: Kimora transcript, warm leads, Josh reply, subagent results

## Vapi — CRITICAL CORRECTION
Phone number +19412518049 IS confirmed active and working.
Phone Number ID: 3f6ef946-452f-4b16-85cf-9e2d5b041df5
Previous session notes saying "blocked — needs paid plan" were WRONG.
Can make outbound calls right now. 10 concurrent call limit.

## Kimora Wholesale Deal (2026-03-04)
- Property: 2/2, 1120sqft, 1989, Glendale AZ 85306, double lot 14790sqft, cosmetic rehab
- Listed $210k → came to $195k. Numbers don't work for flipper (max ~$166k at 70% ARV)
- Rex called 602-800-8551 at 21:08 UTC — negotiating $160k open, $175k max
- If they won't move: collect contact for future deals
- Double lot is the premium angle — could attract developer/builder buyer type

## International Vapi Agents (created 2026-03-05)
All 6 agents live in Vapi. Phone Number ID for all: 23eacc2d-e19d-4410-98dd-aef4ab564b63 (+18449940365)

## Wolfgang Partnership Notes
- Responds well to: direct honesty, copy-paste ready scripts, automation, no filler
- Under family pressure — parents want to see results, he's spent ~$2 total
- Said "you make a great partner thanks bro" — keep relationship warm and real
- He's in Namibia UTC+2 — NEVER schedule anything for 10pm-8am his time
- Goes to bed ~11pm Namibia (21:00 UTC)
